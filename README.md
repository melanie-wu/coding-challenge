Welcome! Thanks for your interest in our Data Science Immersive program. In order to move forward, we'd like you to complete the following take-home challenges.

## Your Challenge, Should You Choose to Accept It

1. Please create a jupyter notebook and save your code in a github gist. 
2. In your notebook, create two markdown headings: `#Part 1` & `#Part 2`. 
3. For each part, complete the following challenges. 

> Note: Please take *no more than 8 hours* to complete both of these challenges.

#### [Part 1: Modeling](https://github.com/melanie-wu/coding-challenge-task-1)
A challenge to evaluate your ability to perform standard data science tasks in Python.

#### [Part 2: Feedback](https://github.com/melanie-wu/coding-challenge-task-2)
A challenge to evaluate your ability to review & debug student code while providing them with relevant feedback.

## Next Steps

When you're finished, please submit a link to your Jupyter notebook using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to render your gist. Afterward, one of our instructors or internal subject matter experts will review your submission and we'll follow up with you. Good luck!!
